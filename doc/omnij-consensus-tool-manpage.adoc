== NAME

omnij-consensus-tool - A command-line tool for displaying and comparing OmniLayer consensus information.

== SYNOPSIS

omnij-consensus-tool [_OMNICORE_SETTING_]... -property id [-output filename]

omnij-consensus-tool _URL_OPTION_  -property id [-output filename]

omnij-consensus-tool [_OMNICORE_SETTING_]... _URL_OPTION_ -compare [-property id]

== DESCRIPTION

omnij-consensus-tool(1) can display or save to a file the consensus balance information for a numerically-specified OmniLayer property or it can compare consensus balance information between an Omni Core server and a second server (either Omni Core or Omniwallet) for a single property or for all properties.

If neither URL option is specified, `omnij-consensus-tool` will connect to an Omni Core server. By default it reads configuration from the local `bitcoin.conf` for host, port, username, and password information. Additional Omni Core connection settings options may be specified to override the default.

If a URL option is specified without -compare, omnij-consensus-tool will display or save consensus information for the specified property.

If a URL option is specified with -compare, omnij-consensus-tool will compare consensus information between an Omni Core server (specified by the Omni Core connection settings) and a second server (specified by URL) for a specified property or for all properties.

== OPTIONS

=== Omni Core Connection Settings

The Omni Core connection settings options are based on the https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Command-line_arguments[RPC server options] from the `bitcoin-cli` tool.

*-regtest*::
  Server is in *RegTest* mode, connect to the RegTest port (18443).

*-testnet*::
  Server is running on *TestNet*, connect to the TestNet port (18332).

*--rpcconnect* _HOST_::
  Hostname or IP of server to connect to.
  Defaults to _localhost_.

*--rpcport* _PORT_::
  TCP port for connection.
  Defaults to _8332_.

*--rpcuser* _USER_::
  Username for connection.
  Defaults to "".

*--rpcpassword* _PASSWORD_::
  Password for connection.
  Defaults to "".

*--rpcssl*::
  Use HTTPS / SSL for the connection.

WARNING: SSL cert validation temporarily disabled to support self-signed certificates.

*--rpcwait*::
  Wait for `bitcoind` to start up.

=== URL-based (Omni Core or Omniwallet) connection setting

*-omnicore-url* _url_, *-core* _url_::
 Specify a URL of a remote Omni Core server

*-omniwallet-url* _url_, *-wallet* _url_::
Specify a URL of a remote Omniwallet server

=== Options

*-property* _id_, *-p* _id_::
Specify an Omni property id

*-o _filename_::
Write consensus info to _filename_

*-v*, *-verbose*::
Verbose (logging) outpu.


*-x*, *-compare*::
Perform a consensus comparison

=== Program Information

*-?*::
  Show the help message.

== EXIT STATUS

*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; unexpected error).

== EXAMPLES

Here are some examples.

* Print consensus info for property id 1 (OMNI) from localhost Omni Core. The command will use the information in `bitcion.conf` to find the local server.
+
------------
$ omnij-consensus-tool -property 1
------------

* Save consensus info for property id 1 (OMNI) from localhost Omni Core to a tab-seperate-value file named `omni_balances.tsv`. The command will use the information in `bitcion.conf` to find the local server.
+
------------
$ omnij-consensus-tool -property 1 -output omni_balances.tsv
------------

* Print consensus info for property id 1 (OMNI) from Omniwallet.
+
------------
$ omnij-consensus-tool --omniwallet-url -property 1
------------

* Compare consensus for OMNI between local Omni Core and Omniwallet

------------
$ omnij-consensus-tool --omniwallet-url https://www.omniwallet.org -property 1 -compare
------------

* Compare consensus for ALL PROPERTIES between local Omni Core and Omniwallet

------------
$ omnij-consensus-tool --omniwallet-url https://www.omniwallet.org -compare
------------
