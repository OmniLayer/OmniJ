== v0.5.9

Released: 2020.03.06

=== omnij-rest-client-mjdk

New module: A JDK 11+ `java.net.http` asynchronous client for Omniwallet. It `extends OmniwalletAbstractClient` and `implements ConsensusService` and is compatible with the existing Retrofit-based `OmniwalletClient`. If you are using JDK 11+ and are looking for an Omniwallet API client with minimal dependencies, this is your JAR.

=== omnij-rest-client-micronaut

New module: Experimental, incomplete Omniwallet Client that uses the Micronaut Http client. This is a proof-of-concept, but development was discontinued in favor of the Modern JDK `mjdk` client above. *Use at your own risk*. Comments welcome.

=== omnij-rest-client

* Upgrade to Retrofit 2.6.4 (OkHTTP 3.12.8)

=== omnij-rpc

* Omni integration tests have temporary workarounds to keep the Travis Omni RegTest tests passing until we update to newer Omni Core for those tests. This is related ot a Bitcoin Core change to the default RPC port for RegTest mode. (The `consensusj` constant `RpcURI.RPCPORT_REGTEST` was changed to reflect Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 and later)

=== omnij-money

* Upgrade to moneta-bp-1.3

* Update to ConsensusJ 0.5.0
