A Java/JVM implementation of the http://www.omnilayer.org[Omni Layer], an open-source, fully decentralized asset creation platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain.

There are currently nine active subprojects of OmniJ. Each of which builds a JAR artifact. All JARs require JDK 8 or later, except where noted.

image::https://api.bintray.com/packages/omni/maven/omnij/images/download.svg[link="https://bintray.com/omni/maven/omnij/_latestVersion"]

WARNING: These binaries have not been audited. Use only on TestNet or RegTest.

=== Building OmniJ

The only prerequisite for building OmniJ is having Java JDK 8 or later installed. All other prerequisites are downloaded automatically by the http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] script.

. Check out this project using Git

    $ git clone https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ.git

. Open a shell and set the current working directory

    cd OmniJ

. Build and test with the provided Gradle wrapper scripts. For Unix/Mac:

    ./gradlew build :omnij-cli:shadowJar
+
or for Windows:

    ./gradlew.bat build :omnij-cli:shadowJar

After a successful build, each `omnij-_module_` JAR can be found in a standard location:

| module | jar path

| `omnij-_module_`
| `omnij-_module_/build/libs/omnij-_module_-_version_.jar`

== Omni Integration Testing with Spock Framework

Integration testing for https://bitcoin.org[Bitcoin] and http://omni.foundation[Omni Protocol] using the http://spockframework.org[Spock Framework].

There are currently two integration test suites contained in this project.


Omni RegTest Tests::
Test Bitcoin and Omni Core RPC calls against an instance of `omnicored` running in RegTest mode.

Omni Consensus Tests::
Use the `getallbalancesforid_MP` RPC to get balances for multiple Omni Protocol currencies and compare them against balance information from several well-known public Omni Protocol servers with consensus-checking Web APIs.

=== In ConsensusJ

Bitcoin RegTest Tests::
Test Bitcoin RPC calls against an instance of `bitcoind` running in RegTest mode.

== Installing pre-requisites

The only prerequisite for running these tests is an installed Java Runtime Environment. Either an Oracle or OpenJDK VM will work. Java 8 or later is required.

All other dependencies are automatically downloaded and cached by the test startup script.

== Running the tests manually

. Check out this project using Git

    $ git clone https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ.git

. Start Omni Core (or bitcoind) on MainNet listening on the standard RPC port on `localhost`. The tests are configured to use the following username and password:

    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=pass

. Open a shell and set the current working directory

    cd OmniJ

. Run the tests with the provided Gradle wrapper scripts. For Unix/Mac:

    ./gradlew :omnij-rpc:consensusTest
+
or for Windows:

    ./gradlew.bat :omnij-rpc:consensusTest
+
The above examples are for the Consensus Test, to run the other test suites replace the `:omnij-rpc:consensusTest` Gradle target with `:omnij-rpc:regTest` for the Omni RegTests or with `:bitcoin-rpc:regTest` for the Bitcoin RegTests.

== Running the tests from Jenkins

To run the test from Jenkins we are using the following (UNIX) shell scripts:

test-omni-integ-regtest.sh::
Runs Omni Core RPC regtest test against a built executable of `omnicored` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.

test-omni-consensus-mainnet.sh::
Runs consensus tests against a built executable of `omnicored` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.

=== In ConsensusJ project

bitcoinj-rpcclient/run-bitcoind-regtest.sh::
Runs BTC RPC RegTest tests against a built executable of `bitcoind` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.


[CAUTION]
Read the scripts carefully to make sure you understand how they work. Take special care to notice the `rm -rf` commands.

== Sample Spock Integration Tests

These sample Spock "feature tests" are from the file https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ/blob/master/omnij-rpc/src/integ/groovy/foundation/omni/test/rpc/smartproperty/ManagedPropertySpec.groovy[ManagedPropertySpec.groovy].

[source,groovy]
----
    def "A managed property can be created with transaction type 54"() {
        when:
        creationTxid = omniSendIssuanceManaged(actorAddress, Ecosystem.OMNI,
                          PropertyType.INDIVISIBLE,
                          new CurrencyID(0),
                          "Test Category", "Test Subcategory",
                          "Managed Token Name",
                          "http://www.omnilayer.org",
                          "This is a test for managed properties")
        generateBlocks(1)
        def creationTx = omniGetTransaction(creationTxid)
        currencyID = new CurrencyID(creationTx.propertyid as Long)

        then: "the transaction is valid"
        creationTx.valid

        and: "it has the specified values"
        creationTx.txid == creationTxid.toString()
        creationTx.type_int == 54
        creationTx.divisible == false
        creationTx.propertyname == "ManagedTokens"
        creationTx.amount as Integer == 0

        and: "there is a new property"
        omniListProperties().size() == old(omniListProperties().size()) + 1
    }

    def "A managed property has a category, subcategory, name, website and description"() {
        when:
        def propertyInfo = omniGetProperty(currencyID)

        then:
        propertyInfo.propertyid == currencyID.getValue()
        propertyInfo.divisible == false
        propertyInfo.name == "ManagedTokens"
        propertyInfo.category == "Test Category"
        propertyInfo.subcategory == "Test Subcategory"
        propertyInfo.url == "http://www.omnilayer.org"
        propertyInfo.data == "This is a test for managed properties"
    }

== OmniJ Command-line Consensus tool

The command-line consensus tool, `omnij-consensus-tool` can be built into a native, self-contained, executable using https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]. You'll need a Java 11 (or later) version of GraalVM, we currently recommend version 20.1.0 (java11).

=== Building

The OmniJ Command-line Consensus tool can be built with the following command:

    ./gradlew :omnij-cli:nativeImage

This will produce a self-contained, executable jar in `omnij-cli/build/omnij-consensus-tool.

=== Running

To run use the following command:

    ./omnij-cli/build/omnij-consensus-tool -?

This will output the tool's command line options.

=== Man Page

See the link:doc/omnij-consensus-tool-manpage.adoc[omnij-consensus-tool Man Page] for further instructions.
