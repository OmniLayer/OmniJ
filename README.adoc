A Java/JVM implementation of the http://www.omnilayer.org[Omni Layer], an open-source, fully decentralized asset creation platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain.

There are currently ten active subprojects of OmniJ. Each of which builds a JAR artifact. The core JARs require JDK 8 or JDK 9. Some optional JARs require later JDK versions.

=== Including the OmniJ Maven Artifacts (JARs) in your build

WARNING: These binaries have not been audited. Use only on TestNet or RegTest.

Although the API is changing, binary releases are available on https://gitlab.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ/-/packages[GitLab.com]. You can download JARs or use the provided Maven coordinates to link to them directly from your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

==== Maven

Add the following to the `<repositories>` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
  <repository>
    <id>consensusj-gitlab-maven</id>
    <url>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/8482916/packages/maven</url>
  </repository>
  <repository>
    <id>omnij-gitlab-maven</id>
    <url>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26583853/packages/maven</url>
  </repository>
----

In the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` add a `<dependency>` element that references the OmniJ JAR that you need. For example if you are using classes from `omnij-core` add the following `<dependency>` configuration:

[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>foundation.omni</groupId>
      <artifactId>omnij-core</artifactId>
      <version>{omnij-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

If you are using the `omnij-jsonrpc` JAR, add the following:

[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>foundation.omni</groupId>
      <artifactId>omnij-jsonrpc</artifactId>
      <version>{omnij-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----


==== Gradle

Add the following to the `repositories` section of your `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
    maven { url 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/8482916/packages/maven' }  // ConsensusJ
    maven { url 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/26583853/packages/maven' } // OmniJ
----

In the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` add an `implementation` configuration that references the OmniJ JAR that you need. For example if you are using classes from `omnij-core` add the following `implementation` configuration:

[source, groovy, subs="attributes"]
----
    implementation "foundation.omni:omnij-core:{omnij-version}"
----

If you are using the `omnij-jsonrpc` JAR, add the following:

[source, groovy, subs="attributes"]
----
    implementation "foundation.omni:omnij-jsonrpc:{omnij-version}"
----

=== Building OmniJ

The only prerequisite for building OmniJ is having Java JDK 11 or later installed (JDK 17 is recommended.) All other prerequisites are downloaded automatically by the http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] script.

. Check out this project using Git

    $ git clone https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ.git

. Open a shell and set the current working directory

    cd OmniJ

. Build and test with the provided Gradle wrapper scripts. For Unix/Mac:

    ./gradlew build
+
or for Windows:

    ./gradlew.bat build

After a successful build, each `omnij-_module_` JAR can be found in a standard location:

[options="header",frame="all"]
|===
| module | jar path

| `omnij-_module_`
| `omnij-_module_/build/libs/omnij-_module_-_version_.jar`

== Omni Integration Testing with Spock Framework

Integration testing for https://bitcoin.org[Bitcoin] and http://omni.foundation[Omni Protocol] using the http://spockframework.org[Spock Framework].

There are currently two integration test suites contained in this project.


Omni RegTest Tests::
Test Bitcoin and Omni Core RPC calls against an instance of `omnicored` running in RegTest mode.

Omni Consensus Tests::
Use the `omni_getallbalancesforid` RPC to get balances for multiple Omni Protocol currencies and compare them against balance information from several well-known public Omni Protocol servers with consensus-checking Web APIs.

=== In ConsensusJ

Bitcoin RegTest Tests::
Test Bitcoin RPC calls against an instance of `bitcoind` running in RegTest mode.

=== Installing pre-requisites

The only prerequisite for running these tests is an installed Java Runtime Environment. Either an Oracle or OpenJDK VM will work. Java 11 or later is required.

All other dependencies are automatically downloaded and cached by the test startup script.

=== Running the tests manually

. Check out this project using Git

    $ git clone https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ.git

. Start Omni Core (or bitcoind) on MainNet listening on the standard RPC port on `localhost`. The tests are configured to use the following username and password:

    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=pass

. Open a shell and set the current working directory

    cd OmniJ

. Run the tests with the provided Gradle wrapper scripts. For Unix/Mac:

    ./gradlew :omnij-rpc:consensusTest
+
or for Windows:

    ./gradlew.bat :omnij-rpc:consensusTest
+
The above examples are for the Consensus Test, to run the other test suites replace the `:omnij-rpc:consensusTest` Gradle target with `:omnij-rpc:regTest` for the Omni RegTests or with `:bitcoin-rpc:regTest` for the Bitcoin RegTests.

=== Running the tests from Jenkins

To run the test from Jenkins we are using the following (UNIX) shell scripts:

test-omni-integ-regtest.sh::
Runs Omni Core RPC regtest test against a built executable of `omnicored` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.

test-omni-consensus-mainnet.sh::
Runs consensus tests against a built executable of `omnicored` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.

==== In ConsensusJ project

bitcoinj-rpcclient/run-bitcoind-regtest.sh::
Runs BTC RPC RegTest tests against a built executable of `bitcoind` in `copied-artifacts/src` directory.


[CAUTION]
Read the scripts carefully to make sure you understand how they work. Take special care to notice the `rm -rf` commands.

=== Sample Spock Integration Tests

These sample Spock "feature tests" are from the file https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ/blob/master/omnij-rpc/src/integ/groovy/foundation/omni/test/rpc/smartproperty/ManagedPropertySpec.groovy[ManagedPropertySpec.groovy].

[source,groovy]
----
    def "A managed property can be created with transaction type 54"() {
        when:
        creationTxid = omniSendIssuanceManaged(actorAddress, Ecosystem.OMNI,
                          PropertyType.INDIVISIBLE,
                          new CurrencyID(0),
                          "Test Category", "Test Subcategory",
                          "Managed Token Name",
                          "http://www.omnilayer.org",
                          "This is a test for managed properties")
        generateBlocks(1)
        def creationTx = omniGetTransaction(creationTxid)
        currencyID = creationTx.propertyId

        then: "the transaction is valid"
        creationTx.valid

        and: "it has the specified values"
        creationTx.txiId == creationTxid.toString()
        creationTx.typeInt == 54
        creationTx.divisible == false
        creationTx.propertyname == "ManagedTokens"
        creationTx.amount == 0

        and: "there is a new property"
        omniListProperties().size() == old(omniListProperties().size()) + 1
    }

    def "A managed property has a category, subcategory, name, website and description"() {
        when:
        def propertyInfo = omniGetProperty(currencyID)

        then:
        propertyInfo.propertyid == currencyID.getValue()
        propertyInfo.divisible == false
        propertyInfo.name == "ManagedTokens"
        propertyInfo.category == "Test Category"
        propertyInfo.subcategory == "Test Subcategory"
        propertyInfo.url == "http://www.omnilayer.org"
        propertyInfo.data == "This is a test for managed properties"
    }

== OmniJ Command-line Consensus tool

The command-line consensus tool, `omnij-consensus-tool` can be built into a native, self-contained, executable using https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]. You'll need a Java 11 (or later) version of GraalVM, we currently recommend version 21.3.0 (java11).

=== Building

Before building you'll need a GraalVM setup on your system. Besides installing the Graal JDK, you'll need to do the following:

1. Set `GRAAL_HOME` to the `JAVA_HOME` of the GraalVM JDK
2. With the GraalVM active, type `gu install native-image` to install the optional `native-image` tool.

On Ubuntu you might need to do: `sudo apt install gcc g++ binutils`. Similar installs of development tools may be needed on other Linux distros.

The OmniJ Command-line Consensus tool can be built with the following command:

    ./gradlew :omnij-cli:nativeCompile

This will produce a self-contained, executable jar in `omnij-cli/build/omnij-consensus-tool`.

=== Running

To run use the following command:

    ./omnij-cli/build/omnij-consensus-tool -?

This will output the tool's command line options.

=== Man Page

See the https://www.omnilayer.org/OmniJ/omnij-consensus-tool-manpage.html[omnij-consensus-tool Man Page] for further instructions.
