 * Specification for the activation of the fee distribution on the distributed token exchange.
 *
 * Once the feature with identifier 9 is active, fees from trading non-Omni pairs are distributed to Omni holders.
 *
 * During the grace period, the old rules are still in place.
 *
 * Note: this test is only successful with a clean state, and requires that the feature is initially disabled!
